# 🧩 Mirror Maze

**Mirror Maze** is a **dual-world puzzle game** where you must control two characters at once: one in the normal world and one in the mirrored world. Every move you make is mirrored, meaning you’ll need to carefully navigate both worlds simultaneously to survive and win.
 
---

## 🚀 How to Play
- The screen is split into **two worlds**: Normal (top) and Mirrored (bottom).
- Move your character using **Arrow Keys** or **A/D**:
  - Left ⬅️ → Top moves left, bottom moves right
  - Right ➡️ → Top moves right, bottom moves left
- Reach the glowing **goal portals** in both worlds.
- If either character touches an obstacle ❌, the level restarts.
- Progress through levels — the higher you go, the trickier it gets!
